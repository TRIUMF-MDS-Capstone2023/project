# Preprocessing

Time is seriously limited in this project. To save training and loading time, we rely on preprocessed [Parquet files](https://parquet.apache.org/), to do preprocessing.

The [`scripts/` folder](https://github.com/TRIUMF-MDS-Capstone2023/project/tree/main/scripts) contains all of the respective preprocessing scripts.
