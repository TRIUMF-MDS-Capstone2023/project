# Final Report

This report summarizes the work done by Crystal Geng, Daniel Merigo, Kelvin Wong, Peng Zhang, as part of the curriculum of the [Master of Data Science program in the University of British Columbia](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/). The project was completed in partnership with scientists at [TRIUMF](https://triumf.ca).

The project was proposed by TRIUMF, Canada's national particle accelerator center, to improve the Ring-Imaging CHerenkov detector (RICH detector) particle identification performance. Our work this year is an extension of the "*RICH AI*" project {cite}`RICHAI`, attempted by an MDS capstone team of similar goals last year.
