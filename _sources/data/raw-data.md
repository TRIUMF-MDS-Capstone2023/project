# Raw Data

The raw data we are working is prepared and provided by TRIUMF, and was stored in the [HDF5](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000229.shtml) format.

The two datasets we work are from the 2021A experiments.

### Main Dataset (`run`)

The main dataset was extracted from a full `RECO` stream, getting the entirety of the Run 11100.

Counting only the pion and muon events, it contains 2,376,174 events and 99,397,075 hits.

### Supplementary Dataset (`pnn`)

The supplementary dataset is much larger, spanning several runs. However, since the events have been filtered, the label distribution is very different.

For the pion and muon events, there are 42,897,096 events and 1,635,601,517 hits.
